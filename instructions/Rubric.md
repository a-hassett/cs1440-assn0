**Total points: 85**

## Penalties

*Please read the "How To Submit Assignments" page of Canvas (found under the DuckieCorp Employee Handbook Module) or in the Lecture Notes repo for more information on these penalties and what we expect.*

***Penalties specific to this assignment***:

0.  **85 point penalty** if your program imports any modules **except**:
    *   `sys`
    *   `os`
    *   Modules provided in the starter code
    *   Modules that you wrote yourself
    *   I want you to have the experience of solving these puzzles for yourself and not to leverage code written by others, no matter how "real-world" it would be to do so.

***Penalties for all assignments***:

#### Project Layout
0.  **10 point penalty** if the repository does not follow the Git Repository Naming Convention
1. **10 point penalty** if the submitted project is not a clone of the starter code repository.
2.  **10 point penalty** if there is an omission of required files and directories (missing, renamed, or moved from their expected location)
3.  **10 point penalty** if there are forbidden files and directories in the submission
4.  **10 point penalty** if there is no `.gitignore` file (whether it is missing or corrupted)
5. **Late Penalty**:
    *   \<24hrs late = -25% total points
    *   \>=24hrs & <48hrs = -50% total points
    *   \>=48hours = -100% total points

#### Modules and Functions
0. **10 point penalty** if a module fails to import due to misspelling or incorrect capitalization.
1.  **10 point penalty** if the program attempts to import a module from the `src.` package; this is the result of a PyCharm misconfiguration.
2.  **10 point penalty** `eval()` or a similar function is used by your program; use type constructor functions such as `int()` and `float()` instead
3. **\<Varies\> point penalty** A library which the grader doesn't happen to have installed is imported; The resulting `ModuleNotFoundError` is treated as a crash and penalized accordingly
4. **20 point penalty** A library not permitted by the instructions is used, but doesn't result in a crash

#### Files and Paths
0.  **10 point penalty** if the program contains hard-coded paths or otherwise does not function when run from *any* CWD.  (Note: names of modules in `import` statements do not count as "hard-coded").
1.  **10 point penalty** if one or more data files are not closed after being processed in *ordinary* situations.  In the event of an error your program will display an error message and immediately exit; in such cases you do not need to take special measures to close files because they will automatically be closed as your program exits.
2.  **85 point penalty** if external programs are called upon to do the work.  Our customer has hired you to create a pure-Python solution, not a shell script that relies on external programs.
    - Do not use `os.system()`, `subprocess`, `pipes` or similar functions and libraries
    - Write a pure Python solution, not a script that leverages external programs

#### All Else
0. **Crashing Code Penalty**:
    * *Reminder: it is your responsibility to test and ensure that your program works on the graders computer*
    *   Code that is crashing and cannot be quickly & easily fixed by the grader will receive a 0% point cap penalty on the implementation portion of the rubric (0 points on implementation)
    *   Code that is crashing and CAN be quickly & easily fixed by the grader (or is only crashing some of the time) will receive a 50% point cap penalty on the implementation portion of the rubric
