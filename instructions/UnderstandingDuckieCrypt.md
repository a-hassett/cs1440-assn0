# Understanding DuckieCrypt

DuckieCrypt is an encoding of the first 95 printable ASCII values. ASCII values are discussed in depth in the lesson `lsn/0-ASCIIChars`.

*   A DuckieCrypt message is a space-separated sequence of DuckieCrypt characters
*   A DuckieCrypt character is comprised of two parts: the `[flag]` and the `[character_code]`.
*   There is no space between the `[flag]` and the `[character_code]`.
*   Examples of valid DuckieCrypt characters are `_0`, `^9`, `_19`, `+A4`, and `+C2`.
    - DC character `_0` has a `[flag]` of `_` and a `[character_code]` of `0`.
    - DC character `^9` has a `[flag]` of `^` and a `[character_code]` of `9`.
    - DC character `_19` has a `[flag]` of `_` and a `[character_code]` of `19`.
    - DC character `+A4` has a `[flag]` of `+` and a `[character_code]` of `A4`.
    - DC character `+C2` has a `[flag]` of `+` and a `[character_code]` of `C2`.


"Hello World!" in DuckieCrypt looks like this:

```
^7 _4 _11 _11 _14 +A0 ^22 _14 _17 _11 _3 +A1
```


## DuckieCrypt Flags

DuckieCrypt flags are *always* one character.  The three valid flags are `^`, `_`, and `+`.

*   `^` denotes that the translated character is **uppercase**.
*   `_` denotes that the translated character is **lowercase**.
*   `+` denotes that the translation will result in a special character: one
    that is printable but is not alphabetic.
*   Any other character used as a flag is an invalid DuckieCrypt character.
    If your program encounters an invalid DuckieCrypt character, skip over it
    without printing anything.


## DuckieCrypt Character Codes

A `[character_code]` follows a flag and determines which *ASCII* character to
translate the DuckieCrypt character to.

*   For the lowercase and uppercase characters, the `[character_code]` is an
    integer.
*   For special characters a `[character_code]` is composed of two parts:
    *   an alphabetic character
    *   an integer
*   The alphabetic character determines which of the 3 special character groups
    the DuckieCrypt character translates to, while the integer that follows
    denotes which ASCII character it is.
*   If your program encounters an invalid DuckieCrypt character code, skip over
    it without printing anything.

## The DuckieEncrypter

In the [`demo`](../demo) directory you will find `duckieEncrypter.py`. This file was
provided to assist you in understanding the conversion of plain text to
DuckieCrypt. It is a tool to create DuckieCrypt from plain text. When no arguments are given,
the program will ask the user for text to crypt. When an argument is given, the
DuckieEncrypter will *encrypt* the text file, and output DuckieCrypt to the
screen.
