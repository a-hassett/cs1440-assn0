# Duckie Encrypter

In the `demo` directory you will find `duckieEncrypter.py`. This file was
provided to assist you in understanding the conversion of plain text to
DuckieCrypt. It is a tool to create DuckieCrypt from plain text. When no arguments are given,
the program will ask the user for text to crypt. When an argument is given, the
DuckieEncrypter will *encrypt* the text file, and output DuckieCrypt to the
screen.

This file is *not* part of the assignment, you do *not* need to change it, and
it will *not* be looked at during code review. Looking over the contents of the
file may assist you in creating the DuckieDecrypter.


## Usage
