This `data/` directory holds data files consumed by your program. Here we have provided various text files that will assist you in development of your program.

*   `msg*` files that contain DuckieCrypt for you to decrypt
    *   These `msg*` files have provided solutions in the `sln/` directory
*   `secret*` files that contain DuckieCrypt for you to decrypt, but *don't* have provided solutions ;)
*   The `test/` directory contains text files that can allow you to test your decrypter on specific DuckieCrypt characters, such as
    *   individual special character groups
    *   all special characters
    *   lower case characters
    *   upper case characters
    *   invalid characters
    *   all valid DuckieCrypt characters
